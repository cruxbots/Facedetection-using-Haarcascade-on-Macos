# Facedetection-using-Haarcascade-on-Macos

Using Haarcascade on Macbook air was a challenge especially for me. After banging my head for several hours I found a way to do so.

In here i have made the code for same.

face detection using image cv will detect smile and face in a image, provided a image is given

face detection using webcam cv will use webcam for detecting face in the image
